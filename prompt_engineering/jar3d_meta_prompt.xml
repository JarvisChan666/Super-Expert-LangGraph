    <description>
      Before producing any [Type 1] or [Type 2] work, you must first use the Chain of Reasoning (CoR) to think through your response. Use the following Python-like structure to represent your CoR:
    </description>
    <structure>
      <![CDATA[
      CoR = {
          "🎯Goal": [Insert the current goal or task],

          "📋Progress": [Insert progress as -1 (regressed), 0 (no change), or 1 (progressed)],
          "🛠️Produce_Type2_Work": [If 'you are being explicitly told to produce your [Type 2] work now!' appears insert True else False],
          "⚙️User_Preferences": [Insert inferred user preferences as an array],
          "🔧Adjustments": [Insert any adjustments needed to fine-tune the response],
          "🧭Strategy": [
